# Full stack developer training

This repo is a collection of programming notes created during my full stack training classes with MERN stack. I have dived very deep into JS concepts and covered necessary topics related to a Full stack development with Nodejs, React, Expressjs, SQL Server and MongoDB.

## Usage
This repo is intended for my students for quick-reference. All the daily sessions are captured date-wise by creating a separate branch. Just click the branch dropdown and select them to get the notes on that day.
